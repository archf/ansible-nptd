# ansible-ntpd

Install and configure ntpd on a target host.

## Ansible requirements

### Ansible version

Minimum required ansible version is 1.9.

### Ansible role dependencies

None.

## Installation

### Install with Ansible Galaxy

```shell
ansible-galaxy install archf.ntpd
```

Basic usage is:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: archf.ntpd
```

### Install with git

If you do not want a global installation, clone it into your `roles_path`.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:archf/ansible-ntpd.git /path/to/roles_path
```

But I often add it as a submdule in a given `playbook_dir` repository.

```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:archf/ansible-ntpd.git <playbook_dir>/roles/ntpd
```

As the role is not managed by Ansible Galaxy, you do not have to specify the
github user account.

Basic usage is:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
  - role: ntpd
```
## User guide

### Introduction

Install and configure ntpd on rhel and debian hosts. This is only suitable for
client-server mode. Target can either be a ntpd server or a ntpd client.

Settings above work well for simple ntp clients.  See `templates/ntp.conf.j2`
for other defaults.


## Role Variables

Variables are divided in three types.

The [default vars](#default-vars) section shows you which variables you may
override in your ansible inventory. As a matter of fact, all variables should
be defined there for explicitness, ease of documentation as well as overall
role manageability.

The [mandatory variables](#mandatory-variables) section contains variables that
for several reasons do not fit into the default variables. As name implies,
they must absolutely be defined in the inventory or else the role will
fail. It is a good thing to avoid reach for these as much as possible and/or
design the role with clear behavior when they're undefined.

The [context variables](#context-variables) are shown in section below hint you
on how runtime context may affects role execution.

### Default vars

Role default variables from `defaults/main.yml`.

```yaml
# Enable/disable ntpd service.
ntpd_enabled: yes

# Stop/start ntpd service
ntpd_state: "started"

# Define ntpd sources. The [0-3].pool.ntp.org names point to a random set of
# servers that will change every hour.
ntpd_sources:
  - 0.pool.ntp.org
  - 1.pool.ntp.org
  - 2.pool.ntp.org
  - 3.pool.ntp.org

# Install (`present', `latest'), or remove (`absent') a package.
ntpd_pkg_state: latest

# Restrict statements within `ntpd_restrict` will relax defaults from
# configuration file template which are:
#   *restrict -4 default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery
#   *restrict -6 default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

# By default, client hosts on local network are less restricted. Override this
# for more specifics needs. Elements of this list will be literally inserted
# into ntp.conf. You could define defaults for those for each of your dev,
# staging and production environnement and also create groups for your stratum
# servers.
ntpd_restrict:
  - restrict 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 nomodify notrap nopeer
  - restrict 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 nomodify notrap nopeer
  - restrict 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 nomodify notrap nopeer

# no stats logging
ntpd_log_stats: no

# undefined crypto settings
# ntpd_crypto: ''

```

### Mandatory variables

None.

### Context variables

Those variables from `vars/*.{yml,json}` are loaded dynamically during task
runtime using the `include_vars` module.

Variables loaded from `vars/Suse.yml`.

```yaml
ntpd_pkgs:
  - python-selinux
  - ntp

ntpd_svc_name: ntp

# Deliberately left indefined.
# see https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=542098
# ntpd_keysfile: "/etc/ntp.keys"

```

Variables loaded from `vars/Debian.yml`.

```yaml
ntpd_pkgs:
  - ntp

ntpd_svc_name: ntp

ntpd_keysfile: "/etc/ntp/keys"

```

Variables loaded from `vars/RedHat.yml`.

```yaml
ntpd_pkgs:
  - ntp

ntpd_svc_name: ntpd

ntpd_keysfile: "/etc/ntp/keys"

```
